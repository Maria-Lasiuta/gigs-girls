'''Question 1
Write short scripts to print the results of the following expressions. In most places, changing integers to floating point produces a notably different result. For example (296167)2 and (296.0167.0)2. Use long as well as complex types to see the differences.

355/113 * ( 1 - 0.0003/3522 )

22/17 + 37/47 + 88/83

(553/312)**2'''

print(355/113 * ( 1 - 0.0003/3522 ))
print(22/17 + 37/47 + 88/83)
print((553/312)**2)
